# Youtube API Testing
It's just me testing to see if I can create a simple "_check data about video_" page.
This has no practical uses other than me derping around with some ideas.

## Then why put your strange emberassing testing thing on Github for everyone to see?
That is a very personal question, but the answer basically boils down to that I have more than one PC that I use for coding, and this is an easy way to move files back and forth!

### That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
Look here buddy, why don't you go f---~~
